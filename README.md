# Ultra Task Manager

A powerful, hybrid system monitoring solution that combines a native Linux Bash script for low-level resource tracking with a modern Node.js web dashboard for visualization.

## 🚀 Features

*   **Real-time Monitoring**: Tracks CPU, RAM, Disk I/O, Network Traffic, and GPU Temperature.
*   **Smart Alerts**: Automatic alerts for high CPU usage and Disk SMART failures.
*   **Hybrid Architecture**:
    *   **Backend (Bash)**: Efficiently collects system metrics and logs them to JSON.
    *   **Frontend (Node.js)**: Serves a responsive web dashboard to visualize the data history.
*   **Desktop GUI**: Includes a native desktop interface using `yad` for local management.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Linux Environment** (Native Linux or WSL2)
*   **Node.js** (v14 or higher) & **npm**
*   **System Tools**:
    *   `yad` (Yet Another Dialog) - for the desktop GUI
    *   `lm-sensors` - for hardware temperature readings
    *   `sysstat` (optional but recommended)

### installing Prerequisites (Ubuntu/Debian)
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y yad lm-sensors nodejs npm
```

## 🛠️ Installation

1.  **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rukaiafawzy/taskmgrr.git
    cd taskmgrr
    ```

2.  **Install Node.js dependencies**:
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install
    ```

## 💻 Usage

### 1. Start the Data Logger (Desktop Mode)
The Bash script is the core engine. It collects data and offers a desktop GUI.

```bash
# Make sure the script is executable
chmod +x taskmgrr.sh

# Run the script
./taskmgrr.sh
```
*   This will open the Desktop GUI.
*   Logs will be generated at: `~/.taskmgrr_data/history_graph.json`

### 2. Start the Web Dashboard
Visualize the collected data in your browser.

```bash
# In the 'server' directory
node server.js
```
*   The server will start on **port 3000**.
*   Open your browser and navigate to: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## 🐳 Docker Support (Optional)

You can also run the web dashboard using Docker:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

*   **No Data in Dashboard?**
    Ensure `taskmgrr.sh` is running. The web dashboard reads the log file generated by this script. If the script isn't running, no new data is recorded.
*   **WSL Users**: 
    Hardware sensors (temperatures) might be emulated or unavailable depending on your WSL configuration.
